(ns dna.Ribosome)
;;reads messenger RNA outputed by transcription
;;and produces a phenome (in real life this is a gene
;;but that process is unessessory when working on binary
;;and it will make this model more complicated then it needs to be
;;this phenome can still be interpred as a gene
;;but that process needs to be done where with in the environment
;;where the agent is applied

;;in biology this would only interpret one Transfer RNA
;;and output its result as a protein
;;but this doesn't make sence for this structure and
;;will make the code more complex and dificult to understand
;;therofre the whole genome is going to be interpreted
;;and it is going to output the wole genome
