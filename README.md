# Artificial-Evolution
Artificial Intelligence Research Project which aims to establish whether Darwin’s theory of natural selection can be used to solve algorithmic problems. Using the Agile Methodology, my first goal is building an environment to force the agents (something that perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon it) to evolve and test out whether they modify with each generation. I will be looking to see if they adapt to the environment just as animals do according to Darwin’s theory. I will be using Java to store agents’ DNA, Clojure to retrieve DNA, translate it into commands, and send it to Netlogo where agents interact with the set environment.
